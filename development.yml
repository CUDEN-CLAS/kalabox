# Core Kalabox development file
#
# This file specifies the core development configuration options for Kalabox.
# This file is loaded instead of kalabox.yml when devMode is on.
#
# You can also drop a development.yml file in ~/.kalabox to
# override the settings found here
#
# This file only works in "normal" mode. Please see the development.yml
# For "devMode" specific configuration.
#
# There are other options beyond what are listed in this file that can be
# overriden although they are currently not officially supported.
#
# Do a `kbox config` to get a sense of what they are. This also should apply
# for kalabox.yml app configurations.
#

#
# Development Mode
#
# Generally you are not going to want to change this
#
#   Options: [true|false]
#
devMode: true

#
# Domain
#
# You can change the domain suffix used by default. The support level of
# this setting is currently unknown.

#

#

# below. Example:
